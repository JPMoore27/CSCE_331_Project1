			<h3>Computer Architecture</h3>

			<p>I've taken the full track of undergraduate computer architecture courses offered at Texas A&M, and I'm familiar with the design of ALUs, branch predictors, caches, pipelining, and out-of-order execution on a register transfer level. I've attended and given presentations on RRAM based storage and hardware accelerators with my  <a href="https://techxplore.com/news/2022-12-memristor-crossbar-based-scalable-energy-efficient-ai.html">research</a>  <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/992757">group.</a></p> 

			<h3>Machine Learning</h3>

			<p>My current research project involves the implementation of tensor-train networks (a neural net where the the weights matrix is decomposed into a 3d tensor) within simulated memristor-based hardware. Right now, I'm working on improving existing MATLAB code simulating the training of a feedforward neural network using backpropagation for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database">MNIST classification.</a> (identifying hand-drawn numbers)</p>

			<h3>Why Memristors?</h3>

			<p>With the recent rise of Large Language Models and other large-scale machine learning projects, the extreme amount of power used by these systems has resulted in both cost and enviormental concerns. <a href="https://www.washington.edu/news/2023/07/27/how-much-energy-does-chatgpt-use/">With some estimating ChatGPT-3 queries resulting in 1GWh of power consumption per day,</a> developing more efficient methods of performing neural network inference calculations as grown into a 100 million dollar problem. I'm interested in memristor-based computing because I believe it may be key to the long term stability of artifical intelligence projects. By arranging memristors into a crossbar array, matrix multiplications can be performed using basic circuit principles instead of flipping transistors, resulting in savings in speed and power consumption.</p>

			<h3>Why Computer Engineering?</h3>

			<p>My whole life I've been fascinated with the process of how a device as complicated as a computer can come about from components as simple as transistors or logic gates. I've always wanted to understand how the things around me worked, but without formal education, electrical and computer systems often just look like magic. Throughout my time in college, I've been learning more and more about the design of computer hardware, and I hope to one day harness that knowledge to build something that will, in some small way, change the world.</p>
