        <h2>Why Magnets Are Cool</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Magnets are amazing and have fascinated scientists and enthusiasts for centuries. Here are some reasons why magnets are so cool:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Magic of Attraction and Repulsion:</strong> Magnets have the unique ability to attract and repel other magnets. This basic property is not only fun to observe but also forms the foundation of many practical applications.</li>
                <li><strong>Invisible Forces:</strong> The magnetic field is invisible to the naked eye but exerts a powerful force. You can explore this hidden world using iron filings to visualize magnetic field lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetized Materials:</strong> Magnets can turn everyday objects into temporary magnets. You can experiment with magnetizing paperclips, nails, or even cereal using a magnet.</li>
                <li><strong>Applications Everywhere:</strong> Magnets are used in countless everyday devices, from refrigerator magnets to MRI machines and electric motors. Understanding magnets can help us appreciate the technology we use daily.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h2>Fun Magnet Experiments</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Ready to have some fun with magnets? Here are a few simple experiments you can try:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Attraction:</strong> Use different magnets to explore how they attract or repel each other. Try to find the strongest and weakest magnets you have.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetized Paperclips:</strong> Rub a magnet along a paperclip multiple times in one direction. You'll notice the paperclip becomes a temporary magnet and can pick up other small metal objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Field Visualization:</strong> Sprinkle iron filings on a sheet of paper placed over a bar magnet. Gently tap the paper to see how the filings align with the magnetic field lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Magnetic Levitation:</strong> Experiment with magnetic levitation by placing a small magnet above another magnet and adjusting the distance to achieve levitation.</li>
            </ol>
