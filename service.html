			<p>Through the ZLP, I've volunteered by helping with a bingo event at a community center in Navasota, and by giving a group of students from San Antonio organization City Kids Adventures a tour of Texas A&M's engineering facilities. I gave shared my experiences and gave advice for what tangible steps someone can take in middle and high school towards preparing for a university education, as well as for how to succeed in college coursework.<p>
